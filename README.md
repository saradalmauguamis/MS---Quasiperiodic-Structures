# MS --- Quasiperiodic-Structures

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks:

- `1D patterns.ipynb`
- `2D patterns.ipynb`

In these notebooks, quasiperiodic structures are generated in one or two dimensions, depending on the file. For comparison, periodic and random patterns are also created in each case. The notebooks analyze and compare the number variance and the diffraction pattern for all these structures.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or newer
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Packages: numpy, matplotlib, scipy, pandas

Install the required packages with:

```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy pandas
```

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the notebooks.
2. Start Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:

   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   jupyter lab
   ```

3. Open `1D patterns.ipynb` and/or `2D patterns.ipynb` and run all cells to generate the results and figures.
